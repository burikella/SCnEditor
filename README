This project is reffered to Open Semantic Technologies for Intelligent Systems (see http://ostis.net/).
Main purpose of this project is to develop human-oriented well-readably markup for writing SCn articles.

To achieve the purpose we need to:
 - determine (clarify) needs of the SCn ML;
 - develop syntax with required for this ML possibilities;
 - develop and implemet the translator from newly created markup to some wide-known format;
 - implemet at least one way to translate developed ML to some of the formats user by OSTIS technology;
 - develop the web-based SCn ML source editor (using JavaScript).

Project plan:
 - writing a number of articles in new ML;
 - using writed examples specify markup format;
 - implement markup parser;
 - develop generator to xml;
 - develop translator to scs from xml;
 - integrate developed parser with Ace (Ajax.org Cloud9 Editor) editor (see http://ajaxorg.github.com/ace/);
 - integrate result editor with MediaWiki system (it's now used system in the OSTIS projects).
